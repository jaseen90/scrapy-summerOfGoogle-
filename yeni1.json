{"description": [" Association Gephi", " Gephi is able to export its network as SVG or PDF format. Using vectorial drawings for graph have many benefits like infinite zooming or clear shapes. The aim of this proposal is to develop a preview module in Gephi for seeing how the output will exactly looks like with the given parameters.\r\n\r\nWhereas the embedded 3D engine is designed for efficient network exploration the vectorial export concentrate on clarity, readability and outstanding design. This module has many different settings like edge thickness, arrow size, white borders around labels, node border and so on. In the vein of WYSIWYG editors we would like to see direct setting change on a Vectorial Preview window. The module must be scalable to support large networks.\r\n\r\nTo resume there are two requirements, previewing the network exactly how it will looks-like in output and support huge graphs efficiently.\r\n\r\nAn approach proposed by the mentors consists in using the output generated by the Gephi Rich SVG Export module to reconstruct and display the network. By importing the demo input \"celegans.gexf\", the generated SVG file has size 1.8MB. Building the preview from an SVG file generated each time an option is (un)checked seems to be a too loud process appearing not to be scalable for large networks, especially on old computers. Moreover, there does not seem to be a \"transitory\" state of data: data is directly exported to SVG in the ExporterSVG class.\r\n\r\nFinally, my approach is to generalize the vectorial transformation process into a class called ExporterVectorial, for instance, in which the final shape of rendering is abstracted: it will create a new transitory data set designed for a vectorial output. By (un)checking any option, ExporterVectorial will be called, generating the vectorial data that a new class VectorialPreview will render on the SVG export panel using Java 2D. When the \"Finish\" button will be pressed, ExporterVectorial will be called again and then ExporterSVG will use the output data to render it into the SVG format. In fact, SVG and preview outputs will come from a same data input designed especially for vectorial rendering. In addition, an idea could be to implement a \"Preview\" checkbox on each vectorial export panel, which would allow people using old computers to choose if they want an automatic preview or not.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the main interrogations are:\r\n    * will the graph be displayed entirely or partially?\r\n    * if displayed partially, how to browse it and make the preview readable?\r\n\r\nAbout the development method, a new Bazaar branch will be created from a \"rather stable\" Gephi development version, and the work will be done on it. Once the GSOC ended, it is hoped that it will be merged into the trunk branch.\r\n\r\nHere is the planning schedule:\r\n    * April 20th - May 23rd: understanding of existing Gephi code, following of current development evolution;\r\n    * May 23rd - June 26th: class diagram design, Java 2D API discovering, rendering few nodes in the preview window then thousands/millions to test performance;\r\n    * June 27th - August 17th: proper development of the proposed approach."], "title": ["\n  Vectorial Preview\n"]},

{"description": [" GNOME", " The goal is to provide an easy way, well integrated into the desktop, to setup DVB devices, record and watch TV shows. The foundation was established during last year's GSoC where I implemented basic features like recording shows and scanning for channels. However, there is still a lot of work to be done so that a non-technical user can make use of my work without problems, too.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to fix outstanding major bugs. Scanning for channels does currently not yield the same results on every scan. The bug might be somewhere in GStreamer's mpegtsparse element. In addition, it's currently not possible to record or watch two or more channels that are part of the same transport stream simultaneously. Only the stream of the channel that is selected first works properly, all other streams are disrupted.\r\n\r\nAlthough, there's basic support for watching live TV (based on gst-rtsp-server) it is a relatively new feature that hasn't seen much testing, yet. First of all, the work should be based on the latest version of gst-rtsp-server. Currently, the biggest downside is that live TV and recordings are two separate parts of the program. Because of that conflicts between live TV and recordings are not resolved. If you are watching live TV and a recording is about to start on a different channel the daemon should automatically switch to the channel of the recording.\r\n\r\nAnother major goal is to better integrate GNOME DVB Daemon into Totem. Only experienced users can make use of Totem's DVB features, because you have to generate the channel list with a command line tool and place the generated file in a special place. Additionally, it's only possible to use multiple DVB adapters if they are all of the same type. DVB Daemon already addresses all of the above issues, but it is not well integrated into Totem, yet.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to access all features (scanning for channels, recording/watching channels, browsing EPG and recordings) of the daemon directly within Totem. Ideally, the user just plugs in his DVB adapter and the assistant to scan for channels is started automatically if the device is not configured, yet.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Totem should use a ring buffer when watching live TV. This allows the user to pause live TV, rewind it and fast forward later. This feature will involve work on GStreamer's queue2 element.\r\n\r\nA simple channel list editor is currently missing, too. That's especially annoying with DVB-S where you have thousands of channels but you are only interested in a small fraction of them. It should be possible to select the favorite channels after the scan is completed.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I want to provide a way to aggregate EPG data from different sources with additional metadata via a plugin system. Some channels don't provide EPG data in their transport stream or the data is incomplete. Retrieving the EPG informations from an online service would obviously fix this problem and may even provide additional metadata.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, I want to add a way to schedule reoccurring recordings so you can easily record you favorite TV show."], "title": ["\n  Improving the DVB experience with GNOME DVB Daemon\n"]},
